# Networking Basics

This repository contains solutions to tasks related to networking basics. Each task focuses on different aspects of networking concepts such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP protocols, TCP/UDP ports, and checking if a host is on the network.

## Tasks

### Task 0: OSI Model
In this task, we explore the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. We learn about the organization of the OSI model and its layers.

### Task 1: Types of Network
Here, we delve into different types of networks including LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet. We understand the typical usage and geographical sizes of these networks.

### Task 2: MAC and IP Address
This task focuses on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. We learn about their definitions and roles in networking.

### Task 3: UDP and TCP
We explore the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocols, understanding their characteristics and differences.

### Task 4: TCP and UDP Ports
In this task, we create a Bash script that displays listening ports, showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

### Task 5: Is the Host on the Network
The final task involves writing a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument to check if a host is on the network.

## Requirements
- Scripts are written in Bash and are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts are executable and pass ShellCheck without any error.
- Each script has a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the first line.
- A README.md file is included at the root of the project directory.
- All Bash script files end with a newline character.
- Each script file includes a comment explaining its purpose.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GOLVEN666/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for the task you want to explore:

    ```bash
    cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x07-networking_basics
    ```

Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of the script file for the specific task.
